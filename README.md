# ORCTM
Oceanic Regional Circulation and Tide Model (ORCTM), including the nonhydrostatic dynamics, can numerically reproduce the dynamics of Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs).

# ORCTM-v2
A new version of the ORCTM for the Cape Verde Tide simulation is called the Cape Verde Tide Model(CVTM).
The CVTM (1/60Â°) is aimed at reproducing the baroclinic tides within the Cape Verde and East Boundary Upwelling regions.
